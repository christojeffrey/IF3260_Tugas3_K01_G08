        <h2>what is 'hollow object'?</h2>
        <div>
          it is a project used to explore webGL 3D. the main goal is for us to learn how to draw 3D objects in the browser. Other than that, we are (forced) to learn shadder, projections (such as orthographic, perspective). this project
          require no third party library.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>how do I use it?</h2>
        <div>
          the page consist of three main part. left part, middle part, and right part

          <ul>
            <li>middle part: it is the 'canvas' this is where the 3D object will be drawn.</li>
            <li>left part: focusing on major canvas changes. like clearing and reseting the canvas.</li>
            <li>right part: this part focuses on object manipulation. such as moving the object in xyz plane.</li>
          </ul>
          we hope the button and slider label is self explanatory. we won't bother explaining it here.

            we have provided three object that you can play around with. unfortunately hollow object doesn't have the ability to create your own object. But we hope you are content with the ability to manipulate with the provided objects.
            Those objects are: Tessaract, Rubic, and Pyramid. you can find and chose them from the top right radiobox.
          </div>
          <div>These objects are hollowed out, that is the reason why this project is called hollow object.</div>
